# C Programming Typing Practice

This program is designed to help students improve their C/C++ programming typing skill. It provides a interactive environment for practicing typing C/C++ code, including keywords and various algorithms.

## Features

- Multiple practice levels:
  1. C Keywords
  2. Beginner Algorithms
  3. Intermediate Algorithms
  4. Advanced Algorithms
- Real-time feedback on typing accuracy
- Side-by-side display of original code and user input
- Automatic indentation for better code readability
- Performance statistics including typing speed, accuracy, and time taken

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- C compiler (Dev CPP)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the `typing_practice.c` file using your preferred C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Choose a practice level from the main menu:
   - 1: Keyword Practice
   - 2: Beginner Algorithm Practice
   - 3: Intermediate Algorithm Practice
   - 4: Advanced Algorithm Practice
   - 0: Exit
5. For keyword practice, type the displayed keyword and press Enter.
6. For algorithm practice, type each line of the displayed function and press Enter.
7. The program will provide immediate feedback on your input accuracy.
8. After completing a function or keyword set, you'll see performance statistics.
9. Press any key to continue to the next practice item or return to the main menu.

## Customization

You can customize the practice content by modifying the following files:
- `level1.txt`: Beginner algorithms
- `level2.txt`: Intermediate algorithms
- `level3.txt`: Advanced algorithms

Ensure that each function in these files is separated by an empty line.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the program or add more practice content are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any bugs or feature requests.
